        Today they are on display at a museum, reduced to
        a relic in the later part of the 20th century.
        Yf-118g has found itself in the National Museum U.S.
        Air Force Dayton, Ohio. The fate of the yf-23 on the
        other hand is not over. While the U.S. has chosen the
        F-22 Raptor, Japan is developing a 5th or 6th-generation
        aircraft and calls out companies to complete their project.
        One such company Northrop Grumman has responded and could
        make a modern version of the yf-23. As for the first
        two aircraft, one of the aircraft has found its way to
        Dayton, Ohio. While the other is at Zamperini Field,
        Torrance, California.

          Following the bird of prey's last flight in 1999,
          breakthroughs and lessons learned throughout the program
          soon found their way to another platform. That being the
          X-45A Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle. As for the aircraft
          itself, it can be seen suspended above a F-22 Raptor at
          Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

          In 2004, Northrop proposed a YF-23-based bomber for the
          USAF need for an interim bomber. Competeing with the
          FB-22 and B1-R, but it was canned in 2006. The USAF has
          moved on to the Next-Generation Bomber and Long Range
          Strike Bomber program. Japan launched a program to
          develop a domestic 5th/6th generation, reaching out
          several companies. Northrop responded, speculation
          that it could offer a modernized version on the
          YF-23 to Japan.
