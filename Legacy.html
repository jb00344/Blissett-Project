    <h2>Legacy</h2>
    <p>
        Today they are on display at a museum, reduced to
        a relic in the later part of the 20th century.
        Yf-118g has found itself in the National Museum U.S.
        Air Force Dayton, Ohio. The fate of the yf-23 on the
        other hand is not over. While the U.S. has chosen the
        F-22 Raptor, Japan is developing a 5th or 6th-generation
        aircraft and calls out companies to complete their project.
        One such company Northrop Grumman has responded and could
        make a modern version of the yf-23. As for the first
        two aircraft, one of the aircraft has found its way to
        Dayton, Ohio. While the other is at Zamperini Field,
        Torrance, California.
