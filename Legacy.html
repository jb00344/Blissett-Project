        Today they are on display at a museum, reduced to<br>
        a relic in the later part of the 20th century.<br>
        Yf-118g has found itself in the National Museum U.S.<br>
        Air Force Dayton, Ohio. The fate of the yf-23 on the<br>
        other hand is not over. While the U.S. has chosen the<br>
        F-22 Raptor, Japan is developing a 5th or 6th-generation<br>
        aircraft and calls out companies to complete their project.<br>
        One such company Northrop Grumman has responded and could<br>
        make a modern version of the yf-23. As for the first<br>
        two aircraft, one of the aircraft has found its way to<br>
        Dayton, Ohio. While the other is at Zamperini Field,<br>
        Torrance, California.
