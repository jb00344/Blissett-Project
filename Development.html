          Despite its futuristic look that seem striaght out of a science
          fiction movie, this aircraft utilized many "off the shelf"
          aircraft components, and relied on existing technology to reduce
          costs while also speeding production. That included the use of a
          control system that was all-manual with no computer assists,
          while the aircraft's landing gear was actually adapted from
          Beech King Air and Queen Air aircraft. Boeing has used
          techniques in the development of X-32 Joint Strick Fighter
          demonstrators and later in its X-45A
          Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle prototype.

          In 1981, USAF requested for an Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF)
          to replace the F-15 Eagle. Prioritizing air dominance and to
          take advantage of emerging technologies. That being composite
          materials, lightweight alloys, advanced flight control systems,
          more powerful engines, and stealth technologies. During this time,
          the U.S. navy annoounced that it would use a variant of the ATF
          winner to replace their aging F-14 Tomcat.
