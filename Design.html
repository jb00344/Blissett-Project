      Named after a Klingon spacecraftform star trek, the jet
      incorporated dramatic desgin inside and out, albeit in
      very different manners. the goal of this aircraft is to
      reduce the radar cross section. In addition to that the
      engines are buried within the fuselage to minimine
      infarared (heat) signature, add the fact that the aircraft
      also comes paint shading to hide the fuselage shapes in broad
      daylight. A measure not used for perveous aircraft
      such as the F-117 (nighthawk) and the B-2 (spirit bomber).

      The YF-23A was an unconventional design, having diamond-shaped
      wings to reduce drag when going at subsonic and supersonic
      speeds. In addition to that, it would have a all-moving V-tail,
      compensating for the lack of elavator would be the flyby wire
      system to account and adjust for instability.
