        Both aircraft are made for stealth.
        One is a proof of concept, and the other is a
        tactical fighter with great speed and range in mind.

          The bird of prey is more of a proof of concept. It was never
          meant to be made in mass numbers. This was when the F-117
          Nighthawk was in service. This aircraft was more focused
          on the shelf components to make it cost effiective.

        <td>yf-23</td>
        <td>
          The YF-23 was designed to meet USAF requirements for
          survivability, supercruise, stealth, and ease of
          maintenance. Supercruise requirements called for prolonged
          supersonic flight without the use of afterburners.
          The supercruise speed is recorded at Mach 1.72, the
          maximum is at Mach 2.2. The combat range of this aircraft
          is around 651 to 695 nautical miles.
