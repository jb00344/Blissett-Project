        The yf-118g was only for a proof of concept.
        The yf-23 was sidelined in favor of the yf-22
        which would be known as the f-22 raptor.

          The goal of the bird of prey isn't to outfly the fighters of
          its day. Its goals were much furthur than that. They han
          managed to do it all for under $67 million. Adjusted for
          inflation to today's currency, Wiechman's Phantom Works
          successfully designed, prototyped, and flew a clean-sheet
          stealth platform for around $111 million, less than the
          cost of a single F-35B today.

          When the time came to submit the evaluation results from both
          LockHeed Martian and Northrop Grumman. The Yf-22 was to be
          the victor. The reason why, the LockHeed and Pratt & Whitney
          engine designs were rated higher on technical aspects, were
          considered lower risks, and were considered to have more
          effective program management. In addition the YF-22 was seen
          as more adaptable to the Navy, but was abandoned.
